# CS 366 - PA6 Analysis

**Name:** [Your Name]
**Date:** [Date]

## 1. DP Comparison: Coin Change vs. Knapsack

**Comparison:**
[Compare the recurrence relations. In 0/1 Knapsack (PA5), we either include item i or not, and look back at the previous row (i-1). In Coin Change, we can use item i and look back at the SAME row (i) or use a 1D array. Explain this difference.]

**Recurrence Relation:**
[Write the recurrence used for minCoins(amount).]

## 2. TSP Complexity

**Trace (N=4):**
[Describe the number of paths explored for 4 cities.]

**Time Complexity:**
[State the Big-O complexity of the brute-force TSP. Explain why 50 cities is impossible (50! is huge).]

## 3. P vs NP & Satisfiability

**Verification Complexity:**
[Explain why iterating through clauses to check an assignment is fast (Polynomial).]

**Reduction Idea:**
[Briefly explain how you might phrase "Is there a tour of cost < K?" as a boolean formula if you had a fast SAT solver.]
